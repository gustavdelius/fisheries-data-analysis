# Mathematical Fisheries Science Projects

There are 4 students supervised by 
[Gustav Delius](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/gustav-delius/)
who are doing their final-year project at the University of York on 
mathematical investigations related to Fisheries Science:

-  [Alexander Steer-Milnes](https://github.com/AlexanderRS-M)
-  [Georgina Shaw](https://github.com/Georgina-Shaw)
-  [Kathryn Dongray](https://github.com/kathryndongray)
-  [Owain Morgan](https://github.com/owainrmorgan)

These projects all involve working with R, either to model fish populations
or to analyse fisheries data. 

We will have weekly meetings as a group during the autumn term and we log
those meetings in [meetings.md](https://github.com/gustavdelius/fisheries-data-analysis/blob/main/meetings.md).
