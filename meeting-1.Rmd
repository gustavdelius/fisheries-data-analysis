We had our first meeting by zoom at 2pm on Friday 9 October 2020. Everyone was
present and everyone briefly introduced themselves.

We agreed that for the rest of the autumn term we will meet weekly at 2pm on Tuesdays via zoom at <https://york-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/5277386983>.

During the first week everyone will concentrate on getting comfortable with R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git and GitHub. For this purpose I recommend to follow the lectures in the MOOC "[The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)". From this we only need weeks 2 and 3 and the first section of week 4.

Before next meeting I would like everyone to create a repository for their final-year project on GitHub. 

As a GitHub challenge: try to edit this file to link your name below to your GitHub repository and then make a pull request. (You will have to figure out what that even means.)
