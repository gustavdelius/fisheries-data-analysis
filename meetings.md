Group meetings in 2000
================

We will have weekly meetings and log here what we have discussed at those meetings.

## 14 October

Our first meeting by zoom. Georgina, Kathryn and Owain were present. We talked
a bit about what made people choose their project. Kathryn liked
ecological modelling and her group project on epidemiological modelling.
Owain feels he is good at programming and likes real-world
applicability. Georgina wants to pursue a career in data analysis.

During the first week everyone will concentrate on getting comfortable
with R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git and GitHub. For this purpose I
recommend to follow the lectures in the MOOC “[The Data Scientist’s
Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)”. From
this we only need weeks 2 and 3 and the first section of week 4.

Before next meeting I would like everyone to create a repository for
their final-year project on GitHub.

As a GitHub challenge: try to edit this file to link your name below to
your GitHub repository and then make a pull request. (You will have to
figure out what that even means.)

-  Alexander Steer-Milnes
-  [Georgina Shaw](https://github.com/Georgina-Shaw/Final-Year-Project-)
-  [Kathryn Dongray](https://github.com/kathryndongray/fisheries-science-)
-  Owain Morgan

I encouraged everyone to ask questions by group email when they run into
any difficulties. During this first term there is nothing wrong with us
relying on each other. There will be plenty of opportunity to prove
independence next term.

Next week I will ask you to start working through 
[“An introduction to basic fisheries analysis with R”](https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/).

We will meet again every Thursday at 4pm (but with a delayed start to allow
everyone to reach a computer).


## 21 October
Everyone present. 

Kathryn has watched some of the videos in the MOOC “[The Data Scientist’s
Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)” and says she had
to enter her credit card but was able to immediately cancel the subscription.
She has been able to set up everything on her computer, but I also show the
[RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) at as an alternative. She has set up
[her profile on GitHub](https://github.com/kathryndongray) where she has two
repositories: one is a fork of mine and the other is a new one she created for
her final-year project. She then edited the meetings.md file to put in a link to
her repository and made a pull request, which I merged into my repository. That
is why her name above is now a link. I would like everyone else to work towards
having the same setup. If you run into difficulties, Kathryn or I may be able to
help.

For next week I would like you to work through the examples in chapters 7 to 9
in [“An introduction to basic fisheries analysis with R”](https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/). This will teach you a lot of
R skills. Then, I would like you to apply some of what you learned to a
data set that I will share with you in a few days.
