Group meetings in 2000
================

We will have weekly meetings and log here what we have discussed at those meetings.

## 14 October

Our first meeting by zoom. Georgina, Kathryn and Owain were present. We talked
a bit about what made people choose their project. Kathryn liked
ecological modelling and her group project on epidemiological modelling.
Owain feels he is good at programming and likes real-world
applicability. Georgina wants to pursue a career in data analysis.

During the first week everyone will concentrate on getting comfortable
with R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git and GitHub. For this purpose I
recommend to follow the lectures in the MOOC “[The Data Scientist’s
Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)”. From
this we only need weeks 2 and 3 and the first section of week 4.

Before next meeting I would like everyone to create a repository for
their final-year project on GitHub.

As a GitHub challenge: try to edit this file to link your name below to
your GitHub repository and then make a pull request. (You will have to
figure out what that even means.)

I encouraged everyone to ask questions by group email when they run into
any difficulties. During this first term there is nothing wrong with us
relying on each other. There will be plenty of opportunity to prove
independence next term.

Next week I will ask you to start working through 
[“An introduction to basic fisheries analysis with R”](https://sfg-ucsb.github.io/fishery-manageR/).

We will meet again every Thursday at 4pm (but with a delayed start to allow
everyone to reach a computer).
